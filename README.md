# How to run
This project benchmarks the performance of a simple HTTP server implemented in Go and Node.js. It measures the time taken to handle requests and compares the performance of both implementations.

To run the benchmark, you need to have both Node.js and Go installed on your machine.

[install node](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
[install go](https://go.dev/doc/install)

First, navigate to the node directory, install the dependencies and run node server:

```
cd node
npm i
node server.js
```

Then, in another terminal, navigate to the go directory and run the Go server:

```
cd go
go get github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2
go run main.go
```

Finally, run the test script to make requests to both servers:

```
bash test-curl.sh
```

results in the terminal will show the responses from both servers.
You should see output similar to:

```
Running Go request...
GO Benchmark: s ms
Sum: xxx

Running Node request...
Node Benchmark: s ms
Sum: xxx
```
